# Deep Learning Image Classification Pipeline

## Project Title
**Developing and Tuning a Deep Learning Pipeline for Real-World Image Classification**

## Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a deep learning pipeline using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model architecture, training, evaluation, and visualization. GitHub is used for version control and collaboration.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
- **Classes**: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck

## Features
- Image normalization and augmentation
- Custom CNN with dropout and L2 regularization
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of training loss

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ProjectNumber_ImageProcessing_YourName.git
cd ProjectNumber_ImageProcessing_YourName
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
```

3. **Run the Project**
```bash
cd code
python cnn_pipeline.py
```

## Output
- Training loss curve saved to `results/training_loss.png`
- Final test accuracy printed in terminal

## Notes
- Make sure you have an internet connection to download the CIFAR-10 dataset automatically.
- Modify hyperparameters inside `cnn_pipeline.py` as needed for tuning experiments.
